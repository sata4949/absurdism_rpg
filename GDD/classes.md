# Class philosophy
- 7 classes, at level X you have the option of moving to an advanced class, or continuing on as a greater core class (name to be changed)
- Each advanced class gains one weapon, and loses 1 weapon with only an addition of advanced class skills, the removal of no skills
- I'm not sure how much of a role lock I want to do for each class, I'm much more concerned in each class feeling different to play
- I think many mob drops will have to relate to some sort of crafting system or purchase system so the player can get the weapon type they want
- I don't want to overly compress weapon types yet even if it feels a little bloated
