# The skill bar
- 3 weapon skills (mainhand (autoattack), mainhand, offhand // or 3 for 2h)
- 3 mixed profession/race skills
- 1 consumable slot
- indicators for all vital energies (Health, Stamina, Class Energy)

# Class energy
- it all boils down to a bar at the end, however generation methods should be different
- all classes will have the option to enhance class energy generation but it shouldn't feel needed
- may want to rework this, or have some more unique feeling things, trying to make this kinda lightweight
## KoL
- Faith - generated over time and striking foes
## PoL
- Illumination - generated over time and healing, starts at half
## Fighter
- Battle Rage - generated by striking foes, starts at 0
## Rogue
- Preparation - generated over time, starts at full
## SoL
- Spiritual Grace - generated over time, starts at half
## SoD
- Life Essence - generated when the life force of other things drops (damage & death)
## Ranger
- Awareness - generated over time, starts at full

# The perk system
## Skill trees
- levelling up grants 1 perk point which can be added to one of 3 families
- after the perks are maxed (level 18), maybe have like perk tiers on major perks to soak until level 33, then levelling just gives stats
- perks within a family alternate between being major an minor, ending at 6 total perks
- for each major perk, there will be 3 options, but only 1 can be selected
- perks can be refunded at any time outside of combat and spent elsewhere, for no cost (open to other ideas)
- advanced classes will replace one of the families of the player's choice with the advanced family, and are unlocked at level 15

# Skills
- a total of 6 profession skills + 2 for each advanced class
- a total of 3 race skills per race
- each consumable will have a global cooldown on it, in addition to it either being a purchased, found, or crafted (?) thing
- restorative, offensive, defensive, and utility options are all available for consumables
- a skill may cost a mix of class energy and having a cooldown
