# The big problem
There is a circle of dark Fae in the centre of the swamp, who are close to enslaving the eldritch being that reigns over the neutral land of the swamp, a land drenched in such miasma that nobody can enter without the protection of a deity, or be at risk of losing themselves to pure chaotic energy. 
After a watchdog of the Fae reports this to the Church of Lumera, one of the last remaining places under the protection of a deity, a call is put out for a party to be formed to protect the entire swamp, and thus, the unlikely party is formed.
The Fae know that a champion will be chosen and tell the church to seek them out specifically, offering blessing to the champion's party free of any condition.

## The PC's relation
- PC will go through some minor quests related to their race/profession (race quest or an outcast version of another race's quest for their home quest for that profession)
- Their final "proving" quest will entangle them with the true version of the Eldritch being, as they are approached in a dream/vision/hallucination/etc. to save the being from causing suffering to the land it desires to protect. 
- The being spends the last of it's energy before descending into a slumber to teach the Player the cure: The Recital of Ornoth, a method of redirecting the energy of the true heart of the swamp into a complete purification spell, without the need for any innate magical talent.
- Of course, the PC can refuse to go, but then it's just ignoring the main quest. There is no other way for the PC to enter the centre of the swamp (roughly 1/3 of the map area), so they will have to eventually.
- Spoiler: the Eldritch being will be corrupted once the party reaches the centre, so it will need to be defeated (driven into a weakened state) for the player to be able to complete the Recital of Ornoth
- Upon completion of the main quest, there will be more quests related to cleanup efforts, and the PC's fame will let them recruit more party members, also the miasma is dispersed so anyone can enter.
- some other unique rewards n stuff
- idk quest writing is hard

## The party
- Really this needs to be drafted by the Player
- I'm not sure how to do this well
- Pick up some party members during the beginner quests, but also have some able to choose from during the party forming/blessing arc
