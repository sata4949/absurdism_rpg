# The gist
- Classes have many weapons, weapon drops should feel limited and powerful
- This means that everything else needs to drop not weapons.
- Armor can drop a little more commonly as I'd like to have it be unrestricted, but still craftable

## Crafting
- Items -> gear, I think I want this done by an NPC interface
- Include a currency cost, certain race/faction specific items may be available? idk yet

## Salvaging
- Gear -> items, has to be able to be done on the go to compress any spare loot (including junk items that could drop as "broken sword", etc, and are meant to be salvaged or sold, but are much more compact in the inventory as salvaged items)
- Destruction should be free, there is no upside to making gear processing a chore, I could see durability charges maybe, but am unsure.
