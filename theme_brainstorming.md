# General Overall Ideas

## Settings
- Swords and kingdoms; knights and mages and dragons and bandits
- Swamp critters; frogs, crickets, cozy vibes and adventure of the ignored
- Enchanted forest; fae, surrealism, any kind of creature you can imagine
- Depression suburbia lmaooo; kids, kids, kids, some horror aspect, breakcore.mp3
- Blood and guns; see doom, rambo, just mostly mindless for the gameplay shoot'em up
- Neon lights; I don't wanna say cyber punk but like cyber punk ;w;
- Some existing IP? Overlord/WH 40k?

## Weapons
### Magic Levels
- High_1: Giant spells, think Thunderaga-EX, big animations, feels powerful but high investment.
- High_2: OP spells, think time stop, fly, etc. Game-defining.
- Low_1: more basic and lifestyle/utility, discourages some pure mage gameplay but lowers the required investment to make a magic build
- Low_2: no fancy spells, but powerful spells. Flames still kills you without it being Fireaga-EX, more scaling of one spell less learning a million spells
- No magic: there is no magic. it is not real.

### Melee
- Traditional fantasy: Swords, hammers, axes, daggers, maces, shields, big swords, big axes
- Fists, baby: self-explanatory. sometimes knives too if you're lame.
- Magic: *ooOOoo-Ooh~* look at my fancy sword made of *mana*

### Ranged
- Guns
- Bows
- Laser beams

## Questing
### Main Quest archetypes
- Restore your honour
- Faction war
- Revenge
- Rescue
- None.
- Prophecy

### General quest design thoughts
- When there's a choice, make it be a true choice.
- Quests to explore locations are good, fetch me x from y is bad
- Delivery is acceptable only when convenient
- Make people use systems after they are introduced, show not tell
- Effective player motivation is crucial, even helping out someone for the sake of it is fine, but being compelled to by railroad gods is not

### Dungeon thoughts
- minimze amount of backtracking
- I personally hate branching paths within a dungeon unless it's tied to quest decisions, raw exploration should either be get lost, or 1 path to an 'end', small loot at the end of cooridors is one thing, but anything I can't see the end of means I need to backtrack to go back and look what it was
- dungeon lighting is incredibly important. we need to get it right
- not all dungeon bosses need to be the big bad evil guy, maybe it's just someone's home you're tresspassing in; you're the bad guy here and you gotta live with that
- dialogue in dungeons is underrated, not everything is just waiting around for you, have there be 

## Misc ideas & Mechanics to include
- Limit save points, quicksave is lame
- Fewer interesting items > more generic items, but not every mob will drop something special
- Playstyles should feel mechanically different from one another; all weapon types should have differences you can feel
- Builds should be able to be tweaked to encourage brewing, perhaps for a cost
- Add select NPCs to party for an undetermined amount of time
- NPCs should have weapon preferences, not just equip the "strongest" thing you give them
- NPC waiting locations -- in a "party reserve"/central area or everyone goes back to their own homes?
- Include some formation mechanic for running around open world with a party without D-tier AI
- Instanced buildings, layered open world including some small terrain
- 1:1 world scale? or slightly less than to run around faster but dungeons and buildings are 1:1?
- Action:Turn-based balance
- Work around restrictive control settings first, expand to pc later

## More specific design notes
- notate every assumption and syntax
- clear descriptions
