# General Overall Ideas

## Settings
- Swords and kingdoms; knights and mages and dragons and bandits
- Swamp critters; frogs, crickets, cozy vibes and adventure of the ignored
- Enchanted forest; fae, surrealism, any kind of creature you can imagine
- Depression suburbia lmaooo; kids, kids, kids, some horror aspect, breakcore.mp3
- Blood and guns; see doom, rambo, just mostly mindless for the gameplay shoot'em up
- Neon lights; I don't wanna say cyber punk but like cyber punk ;w;

## Weapons
### Magic Levels
- High_1: Giant spells, think Thunderaga-EX, big animations, feels powerful but high investment.
- High_2: OP spells, think time stop, fly, etc. Game-defining.
- Low_1: more basic and lifestyle/utility, discourages some pure mage gameplay but lowers the required investment to make a magic build
- Low_2: no fancy spells, but powerful spells. Flames still kills you without it being Fireaga-EX, more scaling of one spell less learning a million spells
- No magic: there is no magic. it is not real.

### Melee
- Traditional fantasy: Swords, hammers, axes, daggers, maces, shields, big swords, big axes
- Fists, baby: self-explanatory. sometimes knives too if you're lame.
- Magic: *ooOOoo-Ooh~* look at my fancy sword made of *mana*

### Ranged
- Guns
- Bows
- Laser beams

## Questing
### Main Quest archetypes
- Restore your honour
- Faction war
- Revenge
- Rescue
- None.
- Prophecy

### General quest design thoughts
- When there's a choice, make it be a true choice.
- Quests to explore locations are good, fetch me x from y is bad
- Delivery is acceptable only when convenient
- Make people use systems after they are introduced, show not tell
- Effective player motivation is crucial, even helping out someone for the sake of it is fine, but being compelled to by railroad gods is not

## Misc ideas
- Limit save points, quicksave is lame
- Fewer interesting items > more generic items, but not every mob will drop something special
- Playstyles should feel mechanically different from one another; all weapon types should have differences you can feel
- Builds should be able to be tweaked to encourage brewing, perhaps for a cost
