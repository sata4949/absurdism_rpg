# General Overall Ideas

## Settings
- Swords and kingdoms; knights and mages and dragons and bandits
- Swamp critters; frogs, crickets, cozy vibes and adventure of the ignored
- Enchanted forest; fae, surrealism, any kind of creature you can imagine
- Depression suburbia lmaooo; kids, kids, kids, some horror aspect, breakcore.mp3
- Blood and guns; see doom, rambo, just mostly mindless for the gameplay shoot'em up
- Neon lights; I don't wanna say cyber punk but like cyber punk ;w;
- Some existing IP? Overlord/WH 40k?

## Weapons
### Magic Levels
- High_1: Giant spells, think Thunderaga-EX, big animations, feels powerful but high investment.
- High_2: OP spells, think time stop, fly, etc. Game-defining.
- Low_1: more basic and lifestyle/utility, discourages some pure mage gameplay but lowers the required investment to make a magic build
- Low_2: no fancy spells, but powerful spells. Flames still kills you without it being Fireaga-EX, more scaling of one spell less learning a million spells
- No magic: there is no magic. it is not real.

### Melee
- Traditional fantasy: Swords, hammers, axes, daggers, maces, shields, big swords, big axes
- Fists, baby: self-explanatory. sometimes knives too if you're lame.
- Magic: *ooOOoo-Ooh~* look at my fancy sword made of *mana*

### Ranged
- Guns
- Bows
- Laser beams

## Questing
### Main Quest archetypes
- Restore your honour
- Faction war
- Revenge
- Rescue
- None.
- Prophecy

### General quest design thoughts
- When there's a choice, make it be a true choice.
- Quests to explore locations are good, fetch me x from y is bad
- Delivery is acceptable only when convenient
- Make people use systems after they are introduced, show not tell
- Effective player motivation is crucial, even helping out someone for the sake of it is fine, but being compelled to by railroad gods is not

### Dungeon thoughts
- minimze amount of backtracking
- I personally hate branching paths within a dungeon unless it's tied to quest decisions, raw exploration should either be get lost, or 1 path to an 'end', small loot at the end of cooridors is one thing, but anything I can't see the end of means I need to backtrack to go back and look what it was
- dungeon lighting is incredibly important. we need to get it right
- not all dungeon bosses need to be the big bad evil guy, maybe it's just someone's home you're tresspassing in; you're the bad guy here and you gotta live with that
- dialogue in dungeons is underrated, not everything is just waiting around for you, have there be 

## Misc ideas & Mechanics to include
- Limit save points, quicksave is lame
- Fewer interesting items > more generic items, but not every mob will drop something special
- Playstyles should feel mechanically different from one another; all weapon types should have differences you can feel
- Builds should be able to be tweaked to encourage brewing, perhaps for a cost
- Add select NPCs to party for an undetermined amount of time
- NPCs should have weapon preferences, not just equip the "strongest" thing you give them
- NPC waiting locations -- in a "party reserve"/central area or everyone goes back to their own homes?
- Include some formation mechanic for running around open world with a party without D-tier AI
- Instanced buildings, layered open world including some small terrain
- Clear map direction and access points a plus
- World map and compass are good pieces of UI to have
- 1:1 world scale? or slightly less than to run around faster but dungeons and buildings are 1:1?
- Action:Turn-based balance
- Work around restrictive control settings first, expand to pc later
- Fast travel is a must.
- Slot-based inventory to support dungeon delving and exploration
- I don't want to implement a crafting system
- The power of drops gained from exploration should be better than items you can get from a merchant at the same time in the game
- Full keybind control and clear settings menu

## More specific design notes
- notate every assumption and syntax
- clear descriptions 

# Combat-Specific Ideas
## Overlying design & Layout
- 2? Weapon skills, a total of 3? class/race skills
- Race skills should have awful scaling so they are less favored but speccing into them to keep them viable should be an option
- Any inclusion of common skills?
- Weapon skills are unique per class, even for the same weapon
- All skills should be cooldown based
- Some offensive, some defensive class skills
- Personal healing skill? yes/no? Some consumable? (also with a cooldown, or have it be a heal over time effect)
- There should be an autoattack chain (in the 1 skill slot) rewarding weaving in skills with autos
- A couple families of skills per class that can be improved by levelling
- A mix of specific augmentations and general buffs as level rewards
- Skill trees that don't lock off, but do reward depth into them and by "max level" (level reached by slightly after the end of the main quest) you should finish 2? skill trees if you fully spec into them
- Including control effects and damage over time, both on weapon strikes and on class skills, albeit sparingly but a viable path to spec into it
- The fewer animation locks the better, but some things should have cast times
- I would like to consider some kind of dodge roll mechanic
- Heal rapidly out of combat, none of this wait spamming between fights

## Targeting
- Tab to set target enemy, can also click on them
- Next target/detarget should be both be possible
- Action for melee skills - stick or mouse direction
- AoEs - Lock to target or cast on mouse
- Projectiles are cast locked on target or in the direction of mouse if no target
